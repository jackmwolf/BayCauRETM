## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/BayCauRETM.git

3. Create a new branch for your contribution:

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

4. Follow the setup instructions in `README.md`.

All development should be done on feature branches, **not directly on `main`**.

## Types of Contributions

You may contribute in many ways, including but not limited to:

- Bug fixes
- New features or enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Tests and validation

If you are unsure whether a contribution is appropriate, feel free to open an issue for discussion.

---

## Development Workflow

- Keep commits focused and logically grouped
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages
- Add or update tests if your change affects functionality
- Update documentation when behavior or usage changes

If the project includes automated tests, ensure they pass before submitting a pull request.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When opening a pull request (PR):

- Target the `main` branch
- Clearly describe what the change does and why it is needed
- Reference related issues if applicable
- Keep PRs as small and focused as possible

Maintainers may request changes or clarifications before merging.

---

## Coding Style

Please follow the existing coding conventions used in the repository:

- Match formatting and naming styles already in use
- Write readable, maintainable code
- Add comments where logic is complex or non-obvious

Consistency helps keep the codebase clean and understandable.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or want to suggest an improvement:

1. Open a GitHub issue
2. Provide a clear and concise description
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable
4. Attach error messages, logs, or examples when possible

Well-documented issues are easier and faster to resolve.
